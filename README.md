Integrate the [Harvest Time Tracking API](https://help.getharvest.com/api-v2/) into your .NET application!

## Installation

To install the Harvest .NET SDK:

- Search for `Harvest.Sdk` in a NuGet package manager, or
- Type `Install-Package Harvest.Sdk` in the NuGet Package Manager Console

## Getting started

### 1. Register your application

To use the Harvest API, you must first register your application. This will provide you with a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that you can use to authenticate your application.

To register your application, visit the [Harvest Developer Portal](https://id.getharvest.com/developers) and click either the **Create new OAuth2 application** or **Create new personal access token** buttons.

### 2. Create a Harvest client object with an authentication method

An instance of the `HarvestServiceClient` class handles building requests, sending them to the Harvest API, and processing the responses. To Create a new instance of this class, you need to provide an instance of `AuthCredential` which contains your OAuth2 or PAT credentials to authenticate requests to the Harvest API.

For more information on initializing a client instance, see the [Getting Started](docs/readme.md) documentation.

### 3. Make requests to the Harvest API

Once you have completed authentication and have a `HarvestServiceClient` instance, you can make requests to the Harvest API. The requests in the SDK follow a similar format of the Harvest API's syntax.

For example, to retrieve a list of all projects, you can use the following code:

```csharp
var projects = await harvestClient.Projects.GetAsync();
```

`GetAsync` will return a `ProjectsResponse` object on success which contains a list of `Project` objects.

For more information on making requests to the Harvest API, see the [Getting Started](docs/readme.md) documentation.
