# Contributing

These guidelines are designed to help you as a contributor to bring your code and skills to the project to make it better.

## Log issues

The best way to get started contributing to the project is to log issues. This can be done by clicking the "Issues" tab at the top of the repository and then clicking the "New Issue" button. You can then select the type of issue you want to log and fill out the form.

> **Note:** Remember to search the existing issues to see if your issue has already been logged. If it has, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

## Pull requests

If you are looking to contribute code to the project, you can do so by submitting a pull request against the `main` branch.

## Bug fixes and minor changes

If you are looking to make a change that does not create breaking changes to the main components and does not affect other downstream callers, you can submit a pull request against the `main` branch.

These changes will be released as part of either a patch or minor release.

## New features

If you are looking to add new features to the project, you can submit a pull request against the `main` branch.

These changes will be released as part of a minor release.

## Breaking changes

If you are looking to make a change that will create breaking changes to the main components or will affect other downstream callers, you can submit a pull request against the `main` branch including the details of the breaking changes. This will allow the maintainers to review the changes and decide if they can be included in the next major release.

## Bug hunting

Contributions don't need to come in the way of code. If you are looking to help out, you can also help by hunting for bugs. This can be done by logging issues for any bugs you find or by helping to triage existing issues.

## Testing and documentation

If you are looking to help out, you can also help by introducing or updating automated tests or documentation in the project. This can be done by submitting a pull request against the `main` branch.
